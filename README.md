## Experimental Immersion 2024

Students will try Pupil Lab's Neon glasses and take a short recording (2-3 min). Students will check the recording on the Pupil Lab's cloud and will see a few analysis results. 

1. Raw gaze positions
2. Main sequence - Max Velocity vs. Amplitude
3. Gaze angle vs. Gravity
4. Saliency map with gaze overlapped

The codes here are dependent on pupillabs_util helper functions (private; https://github.com/grustanford/pupillabs_util).
